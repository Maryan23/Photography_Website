    <h2>1. Underwater waterfall, Mauritius</h2>
    <p>Found in the South West part of the island,the sea appears to have an underwater waterfall. This optical illusion is as a result of the sea floor structure. What we see isn't water plunging into an abyss but particles of soil being pushed by the water current. The soil particles actually plunge down to depths of almost two and a half miles thus creating the apparition of a water fall beneath the sea.</p>

    <h2>2. Love Tunnel, Ukraine</h2>
    <p>The tunnel of love is a railway connecting two cities in UKraine. Throughout the years, nature has turned this speccific route into a beautiful grove making it an attraction especially for couples since it is said that if a couple in true love walks through here and wishes something, then the wish is bound to come true.</p>
