    <h2>1. Underwater waterfall, Mauritius</h2>
    <p>Found in the South West part of the island,the sea appears to have an underwater waterfall. This optical illusion is as a result of the sea floor structure. What we see isn't water plunging into an abyss but particles of soil being pushed by the water current. The soil particles actually plunge down to depths of almost two and a half miles thus creating the apparition of a water fall beneath the sea.</p>

    <p>The tunnel of love is a railway connecting two cities in UKraine. Throughout the years, nature has turned this speccific route into a beautiful grove making it an attraction especially for couples since it is said that if a couple in true love walks through here and wishes something, then the wish is bound to come true.</p>

    <h2>3. "The Door to Hell", Derweze, Turkmenistan</h2>
    <p>In the 1970's Turkmenistan was part of the Soviet Union and the authorities wanted a campaign that would identify all areas of natural resources that culd be mined to support the growing population. In 1971 geologists arrived in the area and speculated that below the ground existed a cavern that had oil. They decided to dig around and ended up finding a pocket of gas beneath the surface. No official information exists on what happened afterwards but close participants in the drilling exercise claim that the ground around collapsed burying the drilling equipment and several scientists at the site. Researchers had a problem because they later discovered that the gas been emmitted was methane which was hazardous. They figured the only way to counter the health hazard was to burn the gas after they calculated that it would take only a few weeks for it to be depleted. A grenade was thrown into the pit and thus the 'gate of hell' was born. 50 years later and the hole is still on fire. The crater's estimated size is 230 feet across and 66 feet deep and has now become one of the most visited sites in the country.</p>
