    <h2>1. Underwater waterfall, Mauritius</h2>
    <p>Found in the South West part of the island,the sea appears to have an underwater waterfall. This optical illusion is as a result of the sea floor structure. What we see isn't water plunging into an abyss but particles of soil being pushed by the water current. The soil particles actually plunge down to depths of almost two and a half miles thus creating the apparition of a water fall beneath the sea.</p>
